# OCPP - Computer Science Edition

The following list of proposed updates, suggestions, and modifications are intended for upcoming iterations of the *Open Charge Point Protocol*.
At present, the *Open Charge Alliance* exercises a cautious approach towards introducing refinement and enhancements, as well as managing
backward and forward compatibility. This occasionally inhibits or delays key advancements in the fast-paced field of electric mobility.
This structured list of proposals seeks to address these issues in a way that everyone, can appreciate and contribute to.

- High availability for network configurations. *upcoming*
- Steuerbaren Verbrauchseinrichtungen nach 14a EnWG. *upcoming*
- JSON-LD context information for JSON data structures. *upcoming*
- Digital signatures for every OCPP command/response, allowing multi-signatures. *upcoming*
- OCPP user role model to overcome the current "everything is done by the root user" approach of OCPP. Users are identified by the digital signature of their commands/responses. *upcoming*
- Modbus/TCP transport within OCPP websockets to allow a direct communication with e.g. smart energy meters located in the remote network of a charging location. *upcoming*
- Efficient transport of binary data within OCPP websockets for e.g. firmware updates and fast measurement data transport. within OCPP websockets
