# Security Policy

We take security very seriously. Therefore we not only created the *End-to-End-Security* extensions but also the *Calibration Law* extensions, but also continuously review security vulnerabilities within the code, and provide fixes in a timely manner.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
Please report security vulnerabilities in the Issues section of this repository. By keeping security issues visible, we leverage our community in helping fix them promptly.

If you are concerned sharing a vulnerability with the rest of the community, you can also send your report to: github@graphdefined.com
