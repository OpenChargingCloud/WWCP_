# WWCP OCPP

This software libraries allow you to build _Open Charge Point Protocol_ services and use case specific gateways between OCPP and the World Wide Charging Protocol (WWCP), e.g. for *EV roaming*. The focus of the *Open Charge Point Protocol* as defined by the [_Open Charge Alliance (OCA)_](https://www.openchargealliance.org) is the communication between e-mobility *charging stations (charge points)*, *Local Controllers* and *Charging Station Operator Systems (CSMS)*.

## Versions

- **OCPP v2.1** is a based on the public OCA specification (DRAFT 2024-09-01) and currently under development. This version is tested regularly at *Open Charge Alliance Plugfests*.

- **OCPP v2.0.1** is provided via OCPP v2.1, as this version is backward compatible to v2.0.1.

- **OCPP v1.6** and the **Security Whitepaper** extensions are fully implemented and at least one tests exists for every charging station or CSMS message. This version was also tested on multiple *Open Charge Alliance Plugfests*.

- **OCPP v1.5** is no longer maintained. If you still need support for this version please send us an e-mail.


## Implementation Details and Differences

The official protocol specifications of [OCPP v1.6](WWCP_OCPPv1.6/README.md), [OCPP v2.0.1](WWCP_OCPPv2.0.1/README.md) and [OCPP v2.1](WWCP_OCPPv2.1/README.md) have unfortunatelly still many protocol design flaws and security issues which are still not addressed completely by the *Open Charge Alliance Technical Working Group (TWG)*. Therefore this implementation provides a rich set of vendor extentions, called [OCPP CSE](OCPP_CSE), and further work-arounds for most of these issues to simplify the daily operations business, high availability or to support additional concepts/methods.


#### End-to-End Cyber Security

OCCP currently on ly offers *hop-by-hop* security via *Transport-Layer-Security (TLS)*. This only provides communication privacy and security against external attackers, but can not secure more complex networking scenarios e.g. with local controllers between the charging stations and the backend(s).

This project provides fills these gaps via ***Digital Signatures*** on all requests, responses and main data structures. Additional ***Signature Policies*** and ***User Roles*** will further limit the attack surface of your critical charging infrastructure and allow you to implement fine-grained access controls. 


#### Overlay Networking

While in the past a single charging station was connected directly to an operator backend, todays charging infrastructure is far more complex. Today we have to support efficient and secure operations for a cluster of colocated charging stations connected to the same grid connection point. Those charging stations often come from different vendors and some sort of local load management shall reduce energy consumption peaks.

This project provides additional data structures and commands to enable overlay networking between charging stations, additional energy meters, local controllers and operator backends. It also provides enhanced network configuration options for *high-available* networking setups to simplify European **AFIR regulations** and US **NEVI requirements** in the US.


#### German Calibration Law (Eichrecht)

The software aspects of the German Calibration Law (Eichrecht) demand a secure communication of meter values, errors (and charging tariff information for ad hoc charging sessions) and a Charging Transparency Software for end users and regulators. Currently OCPP only supports minimal support for this regulatory requirements and thus the expected security benefit does not reach the end users.

This project provides additional data structures and commands to ensure a secure exchange of cryptographic and metrological data and digital calibration certificates.


#### Controllable Loads (German ยง14a EnWG)

Renewable energy sources and smart grids allow an efficient energy demand-side management (DSM) by a mutual information exchange between the distribution grid operator (DSO) and the smart devices in real-time. However all this communication is highly regulated and requires strong cyber security methods to ensure, that this energy management will not become an attack vector against the entire energy grid.

In contrast to the *Smart Meter Infrastructure*, which only defines perimeter security based on *Smart Meter GateWays (SMGW)*, this project uses *end-to-end* signatures to control the energy loads and inform the end users about time spans of *"dimmed"* energy availability.


#### European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Neither RFID cards, nor AutoCharge, smartphone apps and even not ISO 15118 Plug & Charge currently provide a GDPR compliant protection of end users and their data.

This project provides new data structures for encrypting privacy sensitive data and new EV driver authorization methods to avoid user tracking and data abuse.


### Project Security Policy

We take security very seriously. Therefore we not only created the *End-to-End-Security* extensions but also the *Calibration Law* extensions, but also continuously review security vulnerabilities within the code, and provide fixes in a timely manner.

Please report security vulnerabilities in the Issues section of this repository. By keeping security issues visible, we leverage our community in helping fix them promptly.

If you are concerned sharing a vulnerability with the rest of the community, you can also send your report to: github@graphdefined.com
