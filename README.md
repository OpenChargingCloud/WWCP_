WWCP OCPP
=========

This software will allow the communication between World Wide Charging
Protocol (WWCP) entities and entities implementing the
_Open ChargePoint Protocol Version 1.6/2.0_, which is defined by the
Open Charge Alliance. The focus of this protocol are the communication
aspects between a e-mobility charging station and its operator backend.
For more details on this protocol please visit http://www.openchargealliance.org.

## Content

- **Implementation Details and Differences** for [OCPP v1.6](WWCP_OCPPv1.6/README.md) and [OCPP v2.0](WWCP_OCPPv2.0/README.md) to the official protocol specification. The OCPP specification has unfortunatelly many flaws and security issues. This implementation provides extentions and work-arounds for most of these issues to simplify the daily operations business, high availability or to support additional concepts/methods like *European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*  and the *German Calibration Law (Eichrecht)*.
